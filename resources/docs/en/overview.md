DebeHaber is an accounting platform aimed at integrating and sharing data within your teams. You can share your transactional data with your accountant, auditor, or even the CFO. If you are already using an ERP or PointOfSales software in your company, DebeHaber comes with integration codes (API's) that allows you to easily share data to and from the site.


DebeHaber is a team oriented software, meaning that your'e required to either create a team or be invited into one to be able to access any data. Do not register an account if you intend to be invited into a team.

## Registration

Registering a new account, will automatically create a new team. You will be assigned as the owner of this team. As such it's important that the person in charge of the team create the account first and then invite the remaining members.

To register a new account as the owner of a team, simply access the site: www.debehaber.com/register. You will be required to specify the team name along with your basic information (such as name, email, and select a password).

### Inviting other Members

Once the account is created, you can send invites and assign roles to the other users. The invites will be sent by email with a special link to register a user directly under your team.

Note: It's important that other members don't create their own accounts.

Roles help limit the interaction a user has with your data. These are the
- Administrator Role: Has full control over all data and membership.
- Data-Entry Role: Has full control over the data.
- Data-View Role: Can view data.

### Sharing data with other Teams

DebeHaber is designed to share data not only amongst your team, but also between other teams. Let's say you need to share your (or company's) data with an outside accountant or consultant. Instead of inviting different people into your team, you can simply share data of a particular taxpayer with other teams. This way the work becomes more streamlined as all teams are working on the same dataset. There are many benefits of working like this:
- Limit access to dataset
- Working on the same team gives everyone within the team access to similar modules.
- Working on different teams gives each team limited access to modules, and each team then configures write and read access of each member.

Invitations are meant to be shared with members within your organization. Do not share invites with people outside your organization. DebeHaber is designed to share taxpayer information with other teams, and this method is more secure as you can revoke access to a particular team.
